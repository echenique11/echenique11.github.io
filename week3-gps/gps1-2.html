    <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming is a method of collaborative programming used by Dev Bootcamp, employers, and other programs to provide better and more reliable results. It employs each person taking on a role of either Driver or Navigator. Each has different responsibilities but both are active in the process.</p>

    <h2>Why is pair programming important to Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming is important to Dev Bootcamp because not only is it a method that will be used in our jobs after the course is over, it also instills many of the philosophies that Dev Bootcamp believes in. Pair programming builds empathy between the individuals but it also prepares them for continuous pairing with other, different people with different backgrounds.</p>

  <!-- Add your reflection here. 
	I'm very confident with the learning competencies. During this challenge we find a problem with the floating div, and we figure out what was going on, since we set the parent width to a value and the div inside width together were bigger than the parent, so we ue box-sizing to fix the problem.
