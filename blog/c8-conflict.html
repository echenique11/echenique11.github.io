			<section class='sectionNone'>
			It's been a while since I had a conflict with someone else, most of my conflicts are internally and basically occurs when I don't know how to do something and that something is keeping me from doing something else.
			</section>
			<section class="sectionEven">
			I notice that people argue for things that don't make sense to me or get upset about something and doesn't do anything about it, like express how you feel or at least talk about it with someone.

			Take the example that DBC mention on this challenge, it says that she felt like they did not respect her time or value as a programmer, first if she did clean the dishes is because she have the time, and second she clean it because it bothers her, so why feel angry because others didn't notice her, in my case, I would keep cleaning, of course if it doesn't affect my time, if does then I just go by cleaning whatever I can without sacrificing my time, and I'll do it because I want to, and knowing that people may notice and appreciate or maybe they don't, but knowing that I still do it, because I think is the right thing to do.
			</section>
			<section class="sectionNone">
			To me garbage is an issue and when I see some garbage on the floor, it does upset me, but what I do is pick it up and take to the trash can, and if I see who did it I would say something like, you know better!! And that is it.
