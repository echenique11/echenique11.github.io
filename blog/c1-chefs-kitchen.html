        I have to say that when I applied to DBC, in my mind I was going to learn about how to code Ruby and that was it. But once I started preparing myself for the interview  and then working on the curriculum of week 1, I realize that this will be an opportunity  to growth not just as a software developer but as a person as well. I look at this 18 weeks program as the time for me to prepare as a software developer and to test my mindset in a different environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I believe that DBC culture is very challenging and worthy, when you feel part of something , and work as hard as you can for it, then that something becomes part of you, and to be able to create it in an environment of partnership and team work is, to me, the way to go.
        </p>

        I have to say that I feel excited and with fear. Excited because I looking forward to go to NY and meet with my cohort mates and work with them side by side, and with fear to enter to an unknown environment, leaving behind my routine and start a new one, will I adapt? Will I meet all challenges?... Iâ€™m  sure that with the help of my cohort and hard work I will, but still the fear is present.
