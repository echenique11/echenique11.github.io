			After doing some research on Affirmation, I have to say that this make a lot sense to me, because no one knows better of what you are capable off than yourself. It doesn't matter what stereotype group you have been catalog to be part off. You and only you can overcome that predefine standards that have been established to your group.

			<section class='sectionEven'>
			I think Affirmation can help you realize that all you need to do is set up a goal and go for it, since you can look back and notice all you have accomplish and notice that you are able to do that and more. But Affirmation also can be, to me, a way to show you your flaws, because when you look back and see that you haven't accomplish as much as you wanted but tried and couldn't, you might think that it is because of your stereotype group. Son don't think that you haven't accomplish something just because you belong to that group, start think that you haven't accomplish it because maybe you haven't commit to it as much as you suppose to.
