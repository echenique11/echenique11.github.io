			<section class='sectionNone'>
			Stereotype Threat is "fear that you'll confirm a negative stereotype about a group that you belong to" according to study.com.

			This concept is new to me, and I wonder, does it affect everyone ? or just people that were told about this?. 
			</section>

			<section class='sectionEven'>
			It says that people perform worse when ask to state their gender or race before a test, did everyone did worse? or the average did worse?, if not everyone did worse, what those that means? Does it means this person was prepared to take the test? or he didn't know about stereotype threat?
			</section>

			<section class='sectionNone'>
			From all test I took in college, the ones that I did worse was because I didn't study enough or didn't know the material, but no because of stereotype pressure. I know people from around the world, with different race and gender and I have to say that I'm not able to determine their intelligence according to their race or gender, I know that their some studies that has determine that certain race or gender are better at this or that, for example Domincans are always late!!, but I know a lots of Dominicans that are always on time and Americans that are not on time, so when I'm late I don't think is because I'm Dominican, it just that either I get up late, or got lost or anything that I did wrong to be late, but not because I'm Dominican.
